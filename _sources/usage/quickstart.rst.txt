Quickstart Guide
================

This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with [Your Project]. You'll learn how to install the software and run a simple example to see it in action.

Installation
------------

Begin by installing MechPy. You can do this using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mechpy-core

Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed (list any prerequisites if applicable).

Running Your First Example
--------------------------

Now that you have MechPy installed, let's run a simple example to see how it works.

1. First, create a new Python script or open an interactive Python session.

2. Import the necessary modules from MechPy:

   .. code-block:: python

       from mechpy.core import ThreeByThreeTensor

3. Now, let's execute a simple function:

   .. code-block:: python

       M = ThreeByThreeTensor.from_list([[2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 5], [3, 5, 6]])
       print(M.is_symmetric())

This script demonstrates a basic functionality of MechPy. For more complex use cases, refer to the documentation.
